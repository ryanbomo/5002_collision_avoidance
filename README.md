# Collision Avoidance Project
The name of this project is actually kind of misleading. In fact, while collision avoidance was a large part of the project, the ultimate goal was actually to create a tool that can go from AADL to Python autmoatically. Collision Avoidance software was used as the initial design models.

The goal of this project is to create a tool capable of autmatically mapping from AADL to Python. First, AADL was used to design a collision avoidance system. This was then used to create the program in Python. Manual mapping was done between the two, in order to show how paradigms in each lined up. Finally, this mapping was used to create a Java tool for automating from AADL to Python.

## Collision Avoidance Software
The process of creating the collision avoidance software was meant to emulate the process of creating software for a client. Thus, the software went through a series of phases including Requirements Gathering, Design, Component Creation, Development and Testing.


## Automated Translation software
The translator is designed to get input from the user, which will be a file name of aadl format. The program locates the file in the folder and starts the translation process. The translator translates each and every components given in aadl file to respective python format. The code is implemented such that it is open for extension but closed for modification.
